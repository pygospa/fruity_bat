This flappy bird clone is the result of me coding along to a very excellent
*Watch me code* by [Tom Dalling](http://www.tomdalling.com).

It's a ruby project using bundler, so make sure to install Ruby first (however
that works on your OS Distribution), and then bundler with ruby gems:

    $ gem install bundler

After that just cd into the repositories root directory and execute

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec ruby game.rb

... and have fun :)

It was just a finger exercise - I'm not sure yet if I'm extending it.
