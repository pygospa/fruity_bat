This flappy bird clone is based on the result of me coding along to a very excellent
*Watch me code* by [Tom Dalling](http://www.tomdalling.com).

It's a ruby project using bundler, so make sure to install Ruby first (however
that works on your OS Distribution), and then install bundler with ruby gems:

    $ gem install bundler

After that just cd into the repositories root directory and execute

    $ bundle install

to install all dependencies. And after that

    $ bundle exec ruby game.rb

to have fun :)

It was just a finger exercise, and I did some small changes and additions.
Don't know if I ever turn this into something 'real', though - it's just for
fun!
